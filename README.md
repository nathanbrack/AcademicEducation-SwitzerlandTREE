# Reasearch project on academic education (Switzerland TREE)

## Description
In this research project, we analyze how students' socioeconomic backgrounds and psychological resources (a sense of belonging in school and future expectations) relate to the probability to transition from lower- to academic upper-secondary education and from academic upper-secondary to the tertiary education (university). Our research relies on data from TREE (Transition from Education to Employment), a large-scale  longitudinal study on educational and employment trajectories in Switzerland.
